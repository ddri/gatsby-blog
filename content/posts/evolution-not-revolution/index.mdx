The words that we use to describe our activities matter. It feels like only yesterday that I reflected on the "teenage boy energy" of the startup decade's cultural production line. There might have been a time that someone could say "disruption" in a room without being asked politely to stop, but those days are gone. 

The nature of this decade hasn't revealed itself yet. The definition of theme and overarching lived experience is something that we define in retrospect. It doesn't seem to be as simple as "rebuilding after the pandemic", as there are a lot of second-order effects and unintended consequences still occurring. But one thing feels tangible. It's time to let go of the hyperbole.

Let's start with "revolutionary". 

It's time to build "evolutionary" things. Revolutions are where people get shot, societies stall, and so much potential progress is burned on the bonfire of boiling emotions with nowhere else to go but up in flames. 

Evolutionary is a more appropriate word for 2023 and adjacent years. In all areas. Our energy needs require careful conservation and consideration of our existing technologies and markets. Our social norms require a gentle understanding of all the lived experiences in our communities that are psychologically unable to magically switch to whatever extreme of opinion is in vogue on that day. 

We contain multitudes. And these need iterations and evolutions. Not disruption or revolution. And nowhere more so than in our adoption of technology as products that affect our real lives. Something I know myself and many of my colleagues in the quantum computing industry don't take for granted.
